first i want to thank you for the orginaized work, it shows how much you cares and want to learn.
Task 1 :
No Comment, Excellecnt Work.

Task 2 :
Table is overstreched, you had the right idea but missed the value, make width 50% instead of 100%
Otherwise Great

Task 3 : 
we dont want to make the page pink, we want to make it pink when the width is less than 700px
you can fix that by relocating the body style to the following tag
@media only screen and (max-width: 700px) {
  body {
    background-color: pink;
  }
}
Everything else is perfect

Task 4 :
Some notes but neglectable,
you have problems with responsive view,
you can fix it by adding the following tag to the head
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

Task5 :
No Comment, Perfect.

Task 6 : 
You forgot adding tooltip, 
i may change your code to the following
    [title~=iscosoft] {
      border: 5px solid yellow;
    }
instead of
     .tooltip[data-tooltip="ISCOSOFT"] {
        border: 5px solid yellow;
      }

And
    <img src="company.png" title="iscosoft" >
instead of
      <img
        src="img/company.png"
        alt="ISCOSOFT"
        class="tooltip"
        data-tooltip="ISCOSOFT"
      />

this adds tooltip, and useit as a selector
Otherwise,Good Job

Task 9 : 
You Forgot make it responsive, dont worry about it.
Perfect.

Task 10 :
Same As Task 9, This one on me , i was late on feedback
Good Job

Task 11 :
You made it like the IPhone caluclator, not having all equation on screen then caluclate
Which is AWESOME. MUCH harder job
PERFECT WORK.

Task 12 :
It was a nice touch filling the other field in converting, however,
the reason the task requried returning when both values are entered became clear in work
if you enter both valus it skips all the conditions you have and outputs enteredValue1 = enteredValue2
there are 2 ways to fix this come to mine,
the easy way, remove filling the other field and add a check if both values are entered.
the hard way, makes the task complicated, by checking if both values are entered and the converting wasnt right ( it wasn't made by you ) returning error
And / Or, when changing one value, clear the other field.
Good Work.

Task 13 :

Task 18 :
Two Comments
Multiply doesn't work;
you can fix that by changing the X to *, so the evaluate can calucalte it.
and a small note about that extra large display;
you can fix that by changing the width and giving it auto margin.
Good Job.
