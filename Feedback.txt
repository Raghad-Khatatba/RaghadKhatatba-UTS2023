first i want to thank you for the orginaized work, it shows how much you cares and want to learn.
Task 1 :
No Comment, Excellecnt Work.

Task 2 :
Table is overstreched, you had the right idea but missed the value, make width 50% instead of 100%
Otherwise Great

Task 3 : 
we dont want to make the page pink, we want to make it pink when the width is less than 700px
you can fix that by relocating the body style to the following tag
@media only screen and (max-width: 700px) {
  body {
    background-color: pink;
  }
}
Everything else is perfect

Task 4 :
Some notes but neglectable,
you have problems with responsive view,
you can fix it by adding the following tag to the head
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
Good Work
